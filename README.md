# Architecture-design-and-Simulation-of-RISC-V
1. Designed a RISC-V processor using RTL design, Verilog and EDA tools to implement RISC-V ISA. 
2. Implemented a RISC-V architecture which has different modules such as program counter, decoder, instruction and data memory.
3. Minimized power and area by using 3 stage pipe-lining process in which first stage is fetch-Decode, Second stage is
Execute and third stage is memory and write back.

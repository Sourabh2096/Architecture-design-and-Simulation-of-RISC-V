# Architecture-design-and-Simulation-of-RISC-V
1. Designed a RISC-V processor using RTL design, Verilog and EDA tools to implement RISC-V ISA. 
2. Minimized power and area by using 5 stage pipe-lining process which is Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory and Write back.
3. Implemented a RISC-V architecture using different modules such as program counter, decoder, ALU, instruction and data memory and understood micro architecture and functionality of every module.
4. Developed testbench and ran required test cases for all the modules of the RISC-V Processor using Verilog HDL.
5. Integrated and Synthesized all the individual modules and functionality of the processor is verified by executing complex instructions.

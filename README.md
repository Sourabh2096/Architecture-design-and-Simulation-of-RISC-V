# Architecture-design-and-Simulation-of-RISC-V
1. Designed a RISC-V processor using RTL design which supports all Integer type instructions. 2. Minimized power and area by using 3 stage pipe-lining stages which are fetch, decode-execute and write back. 3. Implemented a RISC-V architecture which has different modules such as program counter, decoder, instruction and data memory.
